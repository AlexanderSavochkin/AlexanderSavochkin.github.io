                    <section id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GPIO could be considered one of the options for transferring data at a relatively fast speed
into single-board computers (SBCs), such as the Raspberry Pi. Possible applications include
capturing radio signals for software-defined radio (SDR) or processing data from a microphone
array: each microphone typically captures fewer than or equal to 48K samples per second,
and having a few tens or even hundreds of microphones can result in a significant transfer
rate that needs to be managed.</p>
<p>SBCs, like the Raspberry Pi 4, have substantial computing power and typically
a few gigabytes of RAM, in addition to exposed GPIO pins. The latter makes it easy
to connect them to external devices. Thus, using them as the core of a high-speed data
acquisition and processing system seems attractive.</p>
<p>There are two main approaches for transferring data to/from an SBC via GPIO:
polling (also known as bit-banging) and using DMA. Surprisingly, both can be done in
user space on RPi (although elevated privileges are needed). As shown in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo">https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo</a>, polling is faster, so we will use polling in our experiments.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with polling, though, is that SBCs typically run Linux or another general-purpose
operating system, so the CPU is a shared resource, and the system will interrupt our bit-banging process
from time to time, causing the data flow to stop. Consequently, the data stream has to be buffered on the device side.</p>
<p>We will consider a strategy to minimize interruption of the polling process and try see the transfer rate we can acheive
this way. We will also estimate the interruption time and the required buffer size on the device side which will allow not
to loose any data.</p>
<p>Setting aside 1 core</p>
<p>Turns out that the Linux kernel allows to "set aside" some CPU cores, so the operation system won't schedule any processes to
run on that cores by default. However the system is still aware of this reserved cores and processes can be explicitly assigned
to these cores. There are a few things here we must take into account: first of all, these isolated cores are still interrupted
by system clock. We expect the interruption time to be no more than a few tenths of microseconds, but measuring it is one
of the goals of this work.</p>
<p>The kernel command line parameter isolcpu allows to "isolate set of CPU from disturbences". Let's "isolate" 3rd core or
RPi4 CPU "form disturbance": here is my kernel command line params file <code>cmdline.txt</code>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 ...[SKIPPED]... isolcpus=3</pre>
<p>The only change I made was adding <code>isolcpus=3</code> at the end of file.
Now, when you boot into the system you can use a tool like top/htop and confirm that 3rd core is allways idle.
It is possible to explicitly assign a process to that core:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">taskset -c 3 yes &gt; /dev/null &amp;</pre>
<p>Which starts a dummy process <code>yes &gt; /dev/null</code> on 3rd CPU core. Our strategy is to run the polling process on
the isolated core so we will have minimal interruptions from the OS.</p>
</section><section id="measuring-setup"><h2>Measuring setup</h2>
<p>To measure transfer rate and timing, we will build a simple timing device based on an FPGA,
which has a fast internal counting timer. The device waits for the rising edge of the
"Data Req" (data request) line and sets its 20-bit data output to the timer's value and the
"Data Rdy" (data ready) line. The polling program detects the change in the "Data Rdy"
line, reads and records the 20-bit data value from the parallel bus, and then sets "Data Req" to low on the SBC.
This signals to the timing device that the SBC has successfully read the data, prompting
it to set "Data Rdy" to low. The polling program detects the falling edge of the "Data Rdy"
line and proceeds to the next cycle iteration. The difference in consecutive data reads from
the timing device allows us to measure the time between loop iterations. We need to measure
two values: the average number of cycles per unit of time (to determine throughput) and
the maximum time between two iterations of the loop (to determine the required buffering size).</p>
<p>Here is the wiring diagram of the measuring setup:</p>
<img alt="/images/RPi-Timing-wiring.png" src="images/RPi-Timing-wiring.png" style="width: 675.0px; height: 675.0px;"><p>The reason we use a 20-bit data bus is that we hit the maximum number pins available on Icestick.
The number of GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi is 28, and since the protocol uses 3 lines for control,
we have 25 pins remaining on the SBC side.</p>
<p>The exchange process described above can be visualized as follows:</p>
<img alt="/images/RPi-Timing-Sequence.png" src="images/RPi-Timing-Sequence.png" style="width: 675.0px; height: 675.0px;"><p>The polling program is written in C and uses direct access to GPIO registers in memory. In
order to get access to the memory-mapped GPIO registers known by their physical addresses in
memory, it uses mmap to map the /dev/mem file into the program's address space. See ... for details.</p>
<p>I used verilog to program the FPGA on the "timing device". Both the FPGA and the Raspberry Pi code are available at ....</p>
</section><section id="results"><h2>Results</h2>
<p>The program reads 500M values of the timer from the FPGA and records and dumps the raw 20 lower bits of the timer to a file.
I post-processed the file to calculate the time between two consecutive reads, so we can see the distribution of the time intervals.</p>
<p>Some observations: initially the typical timer increment between reads is aroun 42 timer clicks, here is the first 1000 reads</p>

<p>Since the timer frequency is 50.25MHz, the typical time between reads is 42/50.25MHz = 0.836us, or approximatelly
1.2M reads per second.</p>
<p>After approximately 67K the typical time between reads decreases to 19 timer clicks, or 0.378us, or 2.6M reads per second.</p>

<p>The second observation is that sometimes the timer difference is 0, which means we read the same value twice. My
theory is that it is due to read/write operation reordering, and, perhaps, we need a memory barrier in the polling loop.
Although the <a class="reference external" href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf">perpheral guide for the BCM2711</a>
says that you don't need memory barriers if you work with the same peripheral (see page 6 of the guide).</p>
<p>The third observation is that sometimes the sometimes we get a negative value with a large magnitude and a "compensating" positive value
next to it: 19, 538, -504, 15. It is probably a glitch in the data, like noise in 9th bit of the parallel bus, corresponding to 512 (just a guess).</p>
<p>Occasionaly we have a few hundreds or even a couple of thousands of timer clicks between reads, which is probably due to the the OS interrupts.</p>
<p>Here is the histogram of the time intervals between reads for 500M cycles:</p>

                    <p>Resolvers are rotary transformers used for measuring
rotation angle of a shaft. Resolvers give analog output in form of
phase shift between sinusoidal signals, so the output signal must
be converted into digital form if we want to use them with digital
control systems.</p>
<p>In most modern applications another type of sensor, encoders, is the usual
"go-to" solution for measuring shaft position and velocity: they are inherently
digital which makes it easy to integrate them in modern control
systems, they have higher accuracy and precision then resolvers
and they can cost fraction of equivalent resolver.</p>
<p>Nevertheless resolvers are still applicable. They can operate
in harsh environments such as extreme temperatures, shock/vibration
and ionizing radiation. Resolvers have been around for
longer time so they can be found in old equipment.</p>
<p>Although resolver-to-digital converter ICs exist, we will rely
on a sound card and a programmatic approach in order to read the shaft
angle from a resolver and will have some fun along the way.
In Part 1, we will use a personal computer sound card along with
a bunch of simple tools for understending the pinout, generating
required exitation signals, reading the output and write the code
which will extract shaft angle from the output  signal using PortAdio,
a popular C library for audio.</p>
<p>To begin I purchased a resolver with the labeling "JQH-11-AGS-4/A386" on eBay.</p>
<img alt="/images/jqh-11-agc4-a386.jpg" src="images/jqh-11-agc4-a386.jpg" style="width: 378.0px; height: 504.0px;"><p>A quick internet search didn't yeild any datasheets or documentation,
so let's try blackbox approach. The labeling on the encoder says:
<strong>ROTOR 2 PHASE 9.75 VOLTS</strong> and <strong>STATOR 2 PHASE 10.1 VOLTS</strong>.
Most probably, we have two windings at <span class="math">\(90^\circ\)</span> on the stator
at and two windings at <span class="math">\(90^\circ\)</span> on the rotor. What we need to do is
to provide reference <span class="math">\(\sin\left(\omega t\right)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\cos\left(\omega t\right)\)</span> signals to the stator and read
<span class="math">\(\sin\left(\omega t + \alpha\right)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\cos\left(\omega t + \alpha\right)\)</span> output signals from
the rotor, where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the shaft rotation angle,
<span class="math">\(\omega = 2\pi f\)</span>, where frequency <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is 400Hz (which
is also labeled on the encoder).</p>
<p>The resolver has two bundles of wires coming out of it. Most probably,
one of the bundles corresponds to rotor windings, and another goes to the stator inside.
What puzzles me, though, is that one of the bundles have 4 wires and another bundle has 8.
The 4-wires bundle has red, black, yellow and blue wires, while the
8-wires bundle has red, yellow, white, blue, green, purple, brown and orange
wires. It turns out that there are color standards for the resolver wires,
although 8-wires bundle colors don't match any color code scheme I could find.</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to measure resistance between different
pair of wires, so we can find wires corresponding to the individual windings.
It would be interesting to find out which windings are on the rotor and which
are on the stator. In order to check this I decided to bring permanent magnets to
the resolver and spin the shaft. In this case the windings on the rotor will
work as alternator winding and generate alternating voltage on the
wires corresponding to the rotor, while stator's wires shouldn't have any voltage.</p>

<p>Once we figure out which wire corresponds to which winding we can come up with
a wiring scheme: we will feed the stator winding with two signals having <span class="math">\(90^\circ\)</span>
phase shift between them, so the winding will generate rotating magnetic field inside
the resolver. The rotor winding will generate sinusoidal voltage which will have phase
shift relative to the stator's voltage. The phase shift will correspond to the shaft
angle <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will use left and right audio channels of the sound card to generate two
<span class="math">\(90^\circ\)</span> shifted reference signals. We will use two channels of the LINE IN:
one channel will be used to read the reference signal and another channel will be used
to read the output signal from one of the rotating winding. So will use the following wiring scheme:</p>
<img alt="/images/wiring-diagram.png" src="images/wiring-diagram.png" style="width: 675.0px; height: 675.0px;"><p>Having both reference and output signals helps us to compensate for the unkown
phase shift introduced by the sound card circuitry.</p>
<p>Here is video of the test run of the setup:</p>

</div>
<p>In order to measure the shaft angle we convolve the output signal from rotor
with the reference signals:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{\omega}}^{\frac{\pi}{\omega}} U_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi) \sin(\omega t ) dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
B = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{\omega}}^{\frac{\pi}{\omega}} U_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi) \cos(\omega t ) dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\sin(\omega t + \phi) = \sin(\omega t) \cos(\phi) + \cos(\omega t) sin(\phi),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\frac{\pi}{\omega}}^{\frac{\pi}{\omega}} U_0 \sin(\omega t) \cos(\omega t ) dx = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\frac{\pi}{\omega}}^{\frac{\pi}{\omega}} U_0 \sin(\omega t) \sin(\omega t ) dx = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{\omega}}^{\frac{\pi}{\omega}} U_0 \cos(\omega t) \cos(\omega t ) dx = \pi
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>we can obtain the following relationships between <span class="math">\(A, B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
A = \pi U_0 \cos(\phi)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
B = \pi U_0 \sin(\phi)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\phi = \arctan \frac{B}{A}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since we are creating a software implementation, we operate in discrete time
domain, so we use the discrete counterparts of the formulas above:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
A = \sum_{n=0}^{N} U_0 \sin(\omega n + \phi) \sin(\omega n )
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
B = \sum_{n=0}^{N} U_0 \sin(\omega n + \phi) \cos(\omega n )
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This computation is peformed for both reference and output signals, so we get reference
angled <span class="math">\(\phi_{ref}\)</span> and output angle <span class="math">\(\phi_{out}\)</span>. The shaft angle is then <span class="math">\(\phi = \phi_{out} - \phi_{ref}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is easier if each period corresponds to exact number of samples, so we adjust the frequency slightly: we will
use 400.909Hz instead of 400Hz. This way we will have 110 samples per period at 44100 samples per second.
<span class="math">\(N\)</span> is the number of samples in the signal, must be exact multiple of period.</p>
