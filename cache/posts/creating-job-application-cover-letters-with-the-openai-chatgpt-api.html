<p>Each person has unique lifepath, experiences and skills. Applying to a position of Python developer?
So who cares if you are a passionate rock climber outside of the work? Or may be it is exactly what makes you
distinctive from the crowd of other candidates if the company is a vendor of climbing equipment? In this case you
probably should mention it in your cover letter when apply to a job.</p>
<p>So it is very important to write a unique cover letter for each position you apply to and carefully
consider what in your life experience would bring something to the table.</p>
<p>While this is a very important step, it is also very time and energy consuming. I beleive that LLMs can
help with this task. In this post I will show how to use the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate cover letters
using job descriptions and your extended CV as parts of the prompts.</p>
<p>I think this is beneficial for both the job seeker and the recruiter reviewing the application if done well, at least comparing
to a standard cover letter used across multiple applications since it provides more relevant information about the candidate.</p>
<p>The obvious approach would be to throw your very detailed CV and the job description into the LLM, and with the right prompt
it will generate a cover letter for you. Unfortunatelly this may not work well because the available LLMs have limited
context window and all this information just won't fit into it. So we need to be a little bit more creative and feed the information
in smaller chunks, although I think with new more powerful LLMs with larger context window this may not be necessary, and we can
generate the letter in a single pass, but now we have what we have.</p>
<p>I would suggest to never use the generated text as is, but rather use it as a starting point for your own
cover letter: even though I put some guardrails agains hallucinating and providing false information, sometimes
the model can generate misleading information about your education or experience. So be careful. Another consideration
is that you must have your own judgement about how you want to present yourself to the recruiter: does mentioning
this thing in autogenerated text help you or not? May be change wording or remove it completely?</p>
<p>So, wish you all the best with you job seeking endeavours. I hope this post will help.</p>
